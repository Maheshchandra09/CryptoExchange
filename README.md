# CryptoExchange
This is a flutter application developed to work on with custom ERC-20 tokens of Ethereum Blockchain and to exchange them using smart contracts. This app also includes the functionality of connecting and authorizing to metamask wallet on mobile. There is also real time prices and conversion of popular crypto currencies available inside the app.

# Smart Contracts
The ERC-20 Tokens and the smart contracts which I have used are available in the file tokensfinal.txt.
Otherwise, you can create your own tokens and contracts and work on them similar to token.sol.
Remember to create your own tokens as they require to be approved of allowance.

# Working
This application is developed on goerli test chain of ethereum network. The two tokens are created in two different accounts using the metamask wallet.
These are aproved of allowance and are exchanged using the swapContract.
The real time prices are provided using the ChainLink api smart contracts.

# Running the code
